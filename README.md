# Project Background
Overview:
Sale e Mare is a Java-based, console application designed to simulate a table reservation system for a restaurant. The system supports two types of tables: VIP and Regular, and enables customers to book, cancel, and view their reservations efficiently. Developed with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, the system makes full use of inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, exception handling, collections (HashMap), and file I/O to offer a complete software solution for reservation management.

Purpose:
This project aims to improve the table reservation process by automating table assignments and service fee calculations. It provides customers with a simple and interactive interface while helping restaurant staff manage table availability in real-time. The separation between VIP and Regular tables also enables personalized customer service for different pricing tiers.

Motivation:
Manual reservation methods are prone to errors, such as double bookings or data loss. By introducing automation through programming, this project helps eliminate such problems, reduces workload, and enhances overall efficiency. Additionally, it showcases core software development skills using Java and OOP concepts in a real-world scenario.

Problem Statement:
Traditional restaurant reservations often fail to track availability in real time or preserve customer data between sessions. This system addresses those issues through:

1.Dynamic table tracking, distinguishing between VIP and Regular tables.

2.Data persistence using file I/O to save and load reservation records across sessions.

3.Input validation via custom handlers and exception management to prevent invalid entries.

4.Efficient reservation management using a HashMap data structure that allows quick access, updates, and removal of bookings.
